Tab Assassin (By Google)
========================

This extension manages your tabs for you in Google Chrome.

Idle tabs are automatically closed after 1 hour. Your tabs will not be closed
if the Chrome session is idle. Recently closed tabs can be reopened from a menu.
The expiry duration is (of-course) configurable.

This is a solid, reliable extension that doesn't get in your way.
Here are a few screenshots to show you how it looks:

Note: The development of this extension seemed abandoned and it has been
resurrected by Divye Kapoor. If you're the original owner or Google's
representative who'd like to take over the extension, please get in touch with
me over email.
